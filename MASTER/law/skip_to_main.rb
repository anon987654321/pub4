# A keyboard reader lands on the first focusable thing on the page and tabs
# through the whole navigation before reaching the content, on every page. The
# skip link is the bypass WCAG 2.4.1 asks for.
#
# It belongs to the layout, which is the only file that owns the first focusable
# element. The earlier detector — anything not mentioning a skip target — fired
# on all 423 partials in RAILS, none of which can hold one, and buried the 5
# layouts where the question is real.
