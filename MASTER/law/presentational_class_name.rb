# frozen_string_literal: true

# A class should name what a thing is, not what it currently looks like. Words
# like dim, bold, small and red describe one rendering decision, so changing
# that decision means editing every view carrying the word, and the markup ends
# up asserting a colour it cannot guarantee.
#
# In this tree the cost already shows. The word dim sits on 301 elements across
# three apps and resolves to a different colour in each: --text-secondary in
# brgen, --color-grey-text in amber, --text-secondary in bsdports. The built
# stylesheets carry seven, six and four rules matching it. Two of amber's three
# bare declarations never take effect, and two of bsdports' do not either — they
# lose to a later rule of equal specificity, so the earlier ones are dead weight
# that would come alive if anyone reordered an @use.
#
# Nothing in the markup says which of those a given element asked for, because
# the markup asked only for "dim".
#
# The fix is often an element, not another class: small for a side comment,
# strong and em for emphasis, time for a timestamp. Those carry meaning to
# assistive technology as well as to the stylesheet, and no second declaration
# can quietly override them.
