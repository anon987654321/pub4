# Debt Register

This file separates known debt from ordinary TODO work.

## Tag Legend

- **agent-ignore** — do not chase during narrow patches (constitution scan noise, horizon features).
- **operator-priority** — humans should fix before declaring deploy healthy.

## Current Tracks

### Self-Test Debt

**agent-ignore** — triage only when the task explicitly targets scan rules.

`rake selftest` is clean (0 findings as of 2026-07-16). Triage each new finding as:

- true violation to fix
- scanner false positive
- rule exemption needed
- rule threshold too strict
- known debt to leave alone during unrelated work

### Constitution Scan Debt

**agent-ignore** — `rake constitution` is broader than `rake selftest` and still reports thousands of self-scan findings. Do not chase zero. Track the count down by removing false positives and fixing high-signal violations.

### Web Face Verification

Voice Mode and boot contracts are covered by `web/test/face_boot.test.mjs` (static assertions on `face.runtime.js`). The WebGL primer guard has the same pattern. Manual iOS Safari tap-testing remains operator-priority when boot assets change materially.

Recent: Voice Mode re-arm, wake-word, browser-first TTS (`face.part1.txt`, `face.part5.txt`, `face_speech_runtime.js`).

### Host TTS Binaries

**operator-priority** — TTS end-to-end audio depends on host binaries such as `edge-tts` and `espeak`. Web wiring can be correct while synthesis is unavailable locally. Check `GET /health` deploy.tts_socket and `test -S .master/tts.sock` on vm23.

## Not Debt

- Two `Master::` spines.
- Split rule registries.
- Local `knowledge/` corpus.
- Generated `output/` artifacts.
- Deferred WebGL boot.
- Media-generation severance: re-severed 2026-07-14 (`76b11fec4`) after the
  2026-07-08→09 reintroduction; operator decision confirmed permanent
  2026-07-15. `core/ABSORPTION.md` is the source of truth. If the Ragnhild
  LoRA training loop needs generation capability again, express it as
  `core/world.rb` handlers per the original absorption plan — do not restore
  `lib/io/lora_pipeline.rb`/`video_chain.rb`.
