# MASTER

Constitutional AI runtime in Ruby, OpenBSD-first. Models propose; the constitution validates before durable writes. The web face in `web/` mirrors pipeline state at `https://ai.brgen.no`.

Local boot: `bundle install`, then `bundle exec ruby bin/cli`. Pipeline stages are in `Now::RuntimeMode::PIPELINE_STAGES`; dump with `/orient`. Law is `data/soul.yml` and `data/rules.yml`. Deploy: `DEPLOY/OPERATOR.md`. Media: `/orient replicate` or `bin/video help`. Licensed MIT.
